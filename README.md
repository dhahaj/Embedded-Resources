# LIST of BOOKS

The following is a list of books and magazines that might be useful for your electronics and/or microcontroller hobby.

This list should be viewed as a starting point of books to consider, instead of a list of mandatory books that you must read.

This list is considered a "live document" that will change over time.

## **Digital Design**

* Note: newer editions of some books in this section have migrated towards hardware description languages (HDL) and FPGA design, thus some readers may find older editions more useful for discrete logic and PLD design.  If VHDL / Verilog / SystemVerilog is not in the title, then it is appended in parentheses to make it more obvious which HDL is used by each book.
